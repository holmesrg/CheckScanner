## Installation
 
We recommend installing BlueCats with CocoaPods. CocoaPods is an Objective-C library dependency manager. You can learn more about CocoaPods from [http://cocoapods.org](http://cocoapods.org/).

Add a BlueCatsSDK dependency to your Podfile in your Xcode project directory:

```ruby
pod 'BlueCatsSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/bluecats/bluecats-ios-sdk.git'
```

Now you can install the BlueCatsSDK dependency in your project:

```
$ pod install
```
If you need to update the installed BlueCatsSDK dependency in your project:

```
$ pod update
```
